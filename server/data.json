    "content": "Hi Wix Code community, me again :)\n\nOver the past few weeks, we've discussed ways to make forum questions more accurate, professional and easy to answer to. This is super important, as this helps us be an ever-growing community, where we help one another achieve any goal that comes to mind, regardless of their coding level.\n\nHere's what we came up with:\n\n- Be nice. We love the atmosphere, and we love seeing how much everyone enjoys helping one another. We firmly believe that we should safeguard this culture—this is our space and we should protect it. We have different skills and  different challenges, so don't forget that each one of us was once a code baby :)\n- Do not repeat questions. Use the forum search. There's a great chance that someone has already solved the problem that you are facing. \n- Use meaningful titles. ‘How can I create a collapsing and expanding repeater?’ is a much better title than ‘Help please!’. This makes it easier for people to spot the posts that they can help with.\n- Use Hashtags. makes it #easy #to #follow #topics.\n- Multiple short posts are better than a long one. This allows other people to benefit from our posts after we're done with it. Keeping posts short makes it easy to find answers, and makes the post relevant for more people.\n- Keep questions focused and clear. This will make each question easier to solve, which makes it possible for more people to answer it.\n- Format the text in your question. Use Code blocks, bullets, etc. to make it easier to understand.\n- Refrain from posting a long code. Debugging code is difficult enough when it's a short one. Post only relevant part of code.\n- Provide as many details as possible. Share what you think is right, what you’ve tried to do, and what blocks you. Include any relevant screenshots, code, and URLs to make it easier for others to understand the problem.\n- Acknowledge our peers’ help by marking a 'Top Comment' for the best answer. This will also make it easier to spot the correct answer.\n\n\nLast but not least: WORK HARD, PLAY HARDER!. Have fun in the process ;)\n\n",

    "content": " \nI can change with code page backgrounds with images but not with videos using $w(Document).background.src\nI'm talking about changing between stock Wix background videos in the Wix video manager, not external videos.\n\nSo with the API one can obtain the URLs for images and videos and they look like these:\nwix:image://v1/8034aa3291a54c489a7b7a3121d994f9.png/Bananas.png#originWidth=1177&originHeight=1200\n\nwix:video://v1/11062b_03c50f8fe4a34cc297a984e483a282ef/_#posterUri=/11062b_03c50f8fe4a34cc297a984e483a282eff000.jpg&posterWidth=1920&posterHeight=1080\n\nI store the URL in session storage and then reload the page.\nThen I can change the page background with this code inside the onReady():\n\n$w(\"Document\").background.src = \"wix:image:// ...\";\n\n$w(\"Document\").background.src = \"wix:video:// ...\";\n\n\nWorks for images, fails for videos.\nChrome just fails with this:\n\n \nThis lead me to believe that the URL for the video was bad.\nI spent too much time looking, testing and looking some more for an answer.\nFinally, using MS Edge, I got two different error messages that were helpful:\n\n \n and occasionally: \n \n Plugging one of the Wix video URLs into Chrome gives this 403 error: \n \nSo I have to conclude that Wix/Corvid is not allowing my Wix pages to access stock Wix videos in the Wix video manager - which should be an error on the Wix/Corvid end, not a feature.\n\nHere is a test page so you can see the error messages when requesting a change of video background:\n\n(use Chrome or MS Edge and look at console - FireFox has an error message that blocks the other messages)\nhttps://www.ualmatrix.com/clock-minimal-image \nAfter initial load click the \"Show URL\" button first so you can confirm the current video URL.Then select backgrounds from the \"Theme\" dropdown list.\nNote that the images work (page reloads and changes background image inside the onReady() ), and the videos have various failures:\nSometimes they fail with a 403 message and no backup image, and others show the backup image without an error message.\nOccasionally a CORS error pops up too.\nFull URL for Wix video background \"Ocean\"\nwix:video://v1/11062b_95d34f15761e4114a57b17823228948e/_#posterUri=11062b_95d34f15761e4114a57b17823228948ef000.jpg&posterWidth=1920&posterHeight=1080\n\nApparently, that gets converted internally by the Wix server to:\nhttps://video.wixstatic.com:443/11062b_95d34f15761e4114a57b17823228948e/1080p/mp4/file.mp4\n\nAnd since Wix thinks thinks my Wix page should not have access to that URL, it loads the poster instead (some files do and some don't):\n_#posterUri=11062b_95d34f15761e4114a57b17823228948ef000.jpg&posterWidth=1920&posterHeight=1080  \n\nTo summarize the dilemma:\nIf my Wix/Corvid pages can change stock Wix background images, then the same should also apply to stock Wix background videos. Instead, the video URLs are blocked, resulting in a 403/CORS error.\n\nSince videos are bandwidth intensive, I can see why Corvid would be careful with them, but it seems they went a bridge too far when a Wix/Corvid page cannot access Wix/Corvid stock videos.\n\nMaybe I'm overlooking something I can do on my end, but this looks very much like a problem on the Wix end of things.\n\nWix/Corvid has server settings that allow page background image changes in the onReady() part of pages. But, it prohibits page background videos to be changed the same way as the images.\n\nLooks like a Wix/Corvid system error to me (or a flawed policy), not a feature.\nSince this is a suspected bug, I sent it to tech support.\nThey told me to place the concern in the forums - the usual circular reference games.\n\nAny assistance with this matter is greatly appreciated. \n",

    "content": "\nI have an application that allows end users to click in a table row to select it and assign or unassign themselves to two text fields. Everything works perfectly. However, If two people do this function at the same time, one overrides the other’s changes. Here’s the processing…\nThe table looks something like this:\n  \nUser 1           User 2        Date                Start       End\n \n<Available> Joe Blow       mm/dd/yyyyy hh:mm hh:mm...\n \n<Available> <Available>    mm/dd/yyyyy hh:mm hh:mm...,\n \n…\n[Save ]\n\nA user clicks on a row, say row 1 above to assign himself to the <available> cell in the first row. The code inserts the current user’s name in the User 1 column in row 1 and then writes the row back to the collection using this code:\n\nlet rowData = {\n_id: row_id,\ntitle: rowtitle,\nuser1: rowuser1,\nuser2: rowuser2, \n…\n};\n$w(\"#table1\").updateRow(workrow, rowData);\nwixData.save(\"Schedule\", rowData) // update the row in the underlying collection\n.then((results) => {\nlet item = results; //see item below \n$w(\"#text30\").text = message + \"on \" + rowdate \n})   // Error \n.catch((err) => {\nlet errorMsg = err;\n$w(\"#text30\").text = (\"update error: \" + errorMsg)\nconsole.log(\"save filed: \" + errorMsg)\n});\n\nIf a user selects a row, Presses “Save” his name replaces User 1. If at the same time, another user is looking at that same row and sees it is <available>, after selecting it, his name overwrites the other user’s name when he presses save.\n\nQuestion: Should Wix use the record’s underling update time to sense that user 1 changed the row before user 2 tries to change the same row, knowing that the update  has been changed prior to user 2 pressing “Save”, thus raising an error condition indicating that “another user has changed this same record” or something like that.\n\nOr do you have to code your own record locking strategy? Please advise. Obviously, having to code a concurrent update strategy to manage changes to the underlying database adds orders of complexity to the coding.  It would seem that the updateRow action should manage the timestamps and trigger an error if the row's timestamps changes between updates.  Thanks.",

I have four tabs, Paintings, Drawings, Photography, 3D, each of which is a main page with a bunch of thumbnails. When you click on a thumbnail, it takes you to a subpage with a full size image of that drawing. I cannot figure out how to move from one full size image to the next without having to return to the main page with thumbnails:((. I am using the Graphic Illustrator template from the Portfolios collection, and in that template, there are actually Previous and Next arrows on those subpages. But on each subpage, each arrow is an actual link to the next or previous page. That means that if I later add/remove images in the thumbnail gallery, that Next arrow's link is going to take the viewer to a wrong (old) image. There has to be a more advanced way than manually rewriting all those links! When I go to the Add menu in the Editor, I can add a button (btw, the Button menu does Not have arrows), but I am not prompted to choose an Action for it, it's just am image, to which I can manually attach a link:(. The Wix support person told me yesterday that if I just put the arrow there, it will automatically \"know\" where to point. And of course, if I copy/paste an arrow from the template, it does not know anything, it just brings the old link with it, and points to a random wrong page. I need to find a button with an arrow image on it, which, when put on a subpage, would generate a link to the Next/Previous subpage. Where does that functionality come from?? Thank you.",

    "title": "Member’s Login Session Token Help – Better Wix Coding From Lessons Learned",
    "content": "  \nThis is a simple solution with a longer explanation … \nI thought I should post this to help those whom are using login session tokens on their sites (for their member’s area [aka site’s customers] logins). Most coders are familiar with uncovering nuances and revelations after multiple tries and/or reads on docs. That isn’t an always case, but it does happen. \n\nI recently encountered a situation that is mentioned in Wix docs but not apparent in whole; which is regarding session tokens to login a user. Basically, for a session token type login, there is frontend code that completes the login and there is backend code that initially gets/generates a session token. This type of usage is needed for remote and/or 3rd party type logins. \n\nThe nuance I discovered is that in the second step, which is to complete the login from the frontend, you need to utilize a frontend function (‘onLogin()’) from the ‘wix-users’ library.  This is because the ‘wix-users’ library should be used once the page is loaded, which can be utilized through the ‘onReady()’ event-handler like ‘$w.onReady()’. This is clearly announced in the Wix docs, while the part that a login success (completion) technically is its own promise, and thereby needs to be called is not so apparent. The login from the frontend Wix is a void type promise. Moreover that, those who are familiar with browser usage would know that there is information being exchanged in order to have a completed login that will maintain a session’s persistence throughout the member’s usage.

There is one collection called \"Lieferkosten\", that combines this information in 4 columns/fields:  Country (land), Region (region), Delivery fee (versandkosten) and Delivery time (versanddauer). The names in brackets are the respective fieldkeys.\nUnder the two dropdowns where users can select their region and country, there are 3 textboxes that should display: #text55 (selected country name), #text56 (the delivery fee that corresponds to the selected country), #text57 (the delivery time that corresponds to the selected country)\n\nWhat works so far: The client clicks on the #dropdown2 to select what region he comes from. Upon user input (selection of a region) an On Change function causes the #dropdown1 to be activated and display all the countries that belong to this selected region. The country name selected on #dropdown1 is shown on textbox #text55 (however not thanks to code but to the API connection)\n\nProblem:\n#text56 and #text57 either display nothing or remain unchanged.\n\nI have tried several solutions, checked the fieldkeys many times and they do correspond to what is in the collection. On my latest attempt (which is the code below, where I only tested it on #text56) I get the error message:  \"Wix code SDK Warning: The text parameter of \"text56\" that is passed to the text method cannot be set to null or undefined.\" and on the developer tool I find: \"TypeError: Cannot read property 'versandkosten' of undefined\"\n\n...\nexport function dropdown2_change(event) {\n    uniqueDropDown2();\n$w(\"#dropdown1\").enable();\n    NewQuery();\n$w('#text56').text = NewQuery()\n\n}\nfunction NewQuery() {\n let myTextQuery = $w('#dropdown2').value\n   wixData.query(\"Lieferkosten\").eq(\"versandkosten\", myTextQuery) // the first element here is the field key, not the field name.\n.find()\n.then((results) => {\n if(results.items.length > 0) {\n let item = results.items[0];\n let secondText = item.versandkosten; //the field key of the second column\n let thirdText = item.versanddauer; //the field key of the third column\n    }else{\n //put here the code you want to execute in case of no match.\n    }\n})}\n\n \n\n \n\nI´m very new to corvid and don´t know that much about coding so would really appreciate any corrections or tips even if they are an entirely new suggestion of code :)",

But, the imported rows are added to the current Collection. And if we sync the data to the live Collection, the data is added to that Collection as well.\n\nSo, for example, if we have a sandbox collection of 900 rows, importing a new CSV file results in 1800 rows and so forth and so on.\n\nWe need the imported CSV file to completely replace the current database contents during import and when syncing to the live collection (even if the imported CSV file has fewer rows).

The only problem is that the  \nwixPay.startPayment function does not prompt/return a shipping address.  So I don't know where to ship the goods.  The frustrating part is that if you use the regular Wix Store, the checkout page requires both the billing and shipping addresses.  As far as I can tell, there is no way to modify the lightbox that appears in order to collect more information.\n\nPlease let me know if there is indeed a way to import shipping info from the customers using WixPay.\n\nA picture of the WixPay payment collection lightbox:\n\n\n \n\nHere is the code I am using.  Again, it works, but I just need to add the extra shipping address.\n\n\nPage Code:\n\n\n\n$w.onReady(function () {\n\n const currentPlanObject = $w(\"#dynamicDataset\").getCurrentItem();\n const planId = currentPlanObject._id;\n const planPrice = currentPlanObject.price;\n\n  $w('#button1').onClick((event) => {\n\n let user = wixUsers.currentUser;\n let isLoggedIn = user.loggedIn;\n if (!isLoggedIn) {\n      wixUsers.promptLogin().then(() => {\n        processPlan(planId, planPrice);\n      })\n    } else {\n      processPlan(planId, planPrice);\n    }\n });\n});\n\nfunction processPlan(myId) {\n\n \n    wixPaidPlans.purchasePlan(myId).then(orderObject => {\n      wixWindow.openLightbox(\"Contact\", orderObject)\n       .then((goForIt) => {\n if (goForIt) {\n         wixPay.startPayment(orderObject.wixPayOrderId);\n       }\n      });\n    })\n \n}\n \n\n\nBackend code:\n\n\n \nimport wixData from 'wix-data';\n\nexport function wixPaidPlans_onPlanPurchased(event) {\n\n // Insert a title reflecting the type of transaction, and\n // the event's order object (json) into \n // the collection's data field.\n if (event.order.price.amount === 0) {\n let orderData = {\n \"title\": \"Free plan purchased\",\n \"data\": event.order\n        };\n        wixData.insert(\"planEvents\", orderData);\n    } else {\n let orderData = {\n \"title\": \"Regular plan purchased\",\n \"data\": event.order\n        };\n        wixData.insert(\"planEvents\", orderData);\n    }\n}\n\n\n\nLink to how it would look.  This is a product page, not a subscription page, but the problem is the same:\n https://reexlmain.wixsite.com/nysc/stores/products \n\n",

    "content": "Looking for a bit of help creating an interactive dropdown list. \nTo avoid confusion, I'm not looking for a Menu Navigation Bar dropdown it has to be separate. \nIf this has already been asked, please point me in the right direction. \n\n \n \nI'm trying to create a dropdown list on my home page that links to other pages. \n- It needs 6 options (pages) inside of it.\n- These will then link to their own category pages. (see picture below)  \n\n \nWhen you click one of those options, I would like it to link to the page it relates to.\n\ni.e Adventure in the dropdown will link to the Adventure Tour page. \n\n\nHow did I get the dropdown? \nI turned on the Developer options and grabbed a dropdown box from the user input section. \nTo my understanding these dropdowns are usually for forms, but i've heard that they can be used for what I'm trying to do here. \n\nCurrently, I only have the design setup (pictured above) and you can click the items. But none of those items are linked to anything, as I don't know how to link them to a page or IF that's even possible. \n\nIs there some coding I can do to get this working? \nOr another option of a dropdown list/menu that I could work with?\n\n \n\nI appreciate any help on this, I've been staring at it for hours without any results.\n\n:)",
